## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"[Field Name] cannot be empty"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Looks like this is not an email"_

### What I learned

This challenge doesn’t even look hard, but the way I solved it was really weird. I’m excited and I feel weird at the same time for relying so much on external help.

On top of that, I learned not to compare my day 7 (yes, it’s only been a week since I started learning React) to someone else’s day 100.

### Continued development

- useState()
- customizable react component
- Problem solving techniques

### Useful resources

- [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) - This collection of re-usable, customizable React components gave another dimension to my work
- [Lucide.dev](https://lucide.dev/) - out of a joke my friend turned a simple button to an animated component really cool
- [Zod](https://zod.dev/) - Great library, it helped my understand email validator
